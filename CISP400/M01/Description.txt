/*
Write your code on the Power Server using ssh with nano or write it on your Linux machine and upload it using an sftp client.
(4 pts): Write a source file named M01.cpp that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:

+ 100 3.14
= 103.14

* 4 5
= 20

- 4 10
= -6

/ 4 2
= 2

Read the operation into a string and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants
eg if (operation=="+") ... else if(...)
Read the operands into variables of type double

Do not allow the user to divide by zero.
Do not use a loop, just read one set of inputs and then exit

(6 pts):  makefile
Write your compile and link steps separately.
3 points for creating M01.o
3 points for creating M01, the executable
Scoring
Your code must compile and link to receive credit
Put your code in a subfolder of your home directory called M01:  ~/M01
Name your source file M01.cpp
Name your executable M01
On the Power Server, from the directory with your source file, header file, and makefile, run the following command:
/home1/hermler/scripts/M01/M01Grader
This will test your makefile and each operand and give you a score out of 10
Shortly after the due date I will run the same script to record your score and then upload it to Canvas.
